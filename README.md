# Vampelvis: The Game

Vampelvis was created as an end-of-semester project for the course "Game Development in C++", held during the summer semester of 19/20 at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Mathematics by the Belgrade branch of Ubisoft.

## The Team

The game was developed by a three-person team (code-named Team Bird Splinter) consisting of:
* [Olivera Popović](https://github.com/popovic-olivera)
* [Aleksandra Stojanović](https://github.com/alex-x-o)
* [Konstantin Klima](https://github.com/konstantin-klima)

The mentor for this project was [Nikola Šobajić](https://github.com/sobajic), a game developer at Ubisoft and the lecturer on this course. 

## The Goal

The minimal goal for this project assignment was to create a game similar to [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). 
We decided to further develop the game by keeping only the essential concepts of the game (gravity, obstacles and jumping) and adding new mechanics like powerups, flying enemies and elaborate theming.
We chose a vampire theme and tried  to keep with it by creating custom textures, music and overall feeling.

## The Technology

The game was developed in C++, and is based on [the engine](https://github.com/sobajic/MATFGame) developed for this course.
The engine itself relies on [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).
